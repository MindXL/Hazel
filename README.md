# Hazel
Hazel Engine (Only for study purpose. Original author: TheCherno)



This is a project only for my own study purpose. I'm watching these very episodes(https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) of making a game engine to learn more about C++. There is absolutely no commercial purpose at all.



# Ask myself

### Is this just a compelete copy of the original Hazel Engine?

Well, I do this not only to learn C++, but also to learn about many other things. There might be some code modified as to my own understanding of writing codes and C++20 or higher.



### Will this project be used in the future?

Maybe not. Because I'm not very interested in game for now. I'm not trying to make games. But this will be a forerunner in respect of how games are made.
